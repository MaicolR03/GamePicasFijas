How to Play "Picas y Fijas" Between Two Players (4-Digit Version)

Picas y Fijas is a popular number-guessing game where two players try to guess each other's secret 4-digit number. Here are the steps to play:

Objective
Each player must guess the 4-digit number that their opponent has secretly chosen. The digits in the number must be unique, and no digit should be repeated.

Game Setup
Choose a Secret Number: Each player secretly writes down a 4-digit number with unique digits (e.g., 1234). No digit should repeat in the number.
Take Turns Guessing: Players alternate turns guessing the opponent's number.
Gameplay
On each player's turn:

Make a Guess: The player will guess a 4-digit number (e.g., 5678).
Give Feedback (Picas and Fijas):
Fijas: A "Fija" is when the guessed digit is in the correct position.
Picas: A "Pica" is when the guessed digit is correct but in the wrong position.
Example: If Player A's secret number is 1234 and Player B guesses 1357, Player A will respond with 1 Fija and 1 Pica:
1 Fija (the digit 1 is in the correct position).
1 Pica (the digit 3 is correct but in the wrong position).
Continue Guessing: The game continues with each player trying to deduce the opponent's number based on the number of "Fijas" and "Picas" they receive as feedback after each guess.
Winning
The first player to correctly guess the opponent's 4-digit number (getting 4 Fijas) wins the game.

Example Game
Player A secretly chooses 1234.
Player B guesses 1357. Player A responds with 1 Fija and 1 Pica.
Player A guesses 5678. Player B responds with 0 Fijas and 0 Picas.
The game continues until one player guesses the opponent's number exactly (4 Fijas).
The game is strategic and requires deduction and logic, making it both fun and challenging.
